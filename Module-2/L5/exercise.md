# 2.5 Exercise: Deploy more apps

Now just try deploying the rest of these apps. Some might be more complicated than others!

## MongoDB & Mongo Express

Similarly to PostgreSQL and PgAdmin4, MongoDB is a database server and Mongo Express is the web-ui you can use to access your data. These apps will share `mongodb_secret.yaml`. 

MongoDB is a document-based database utiliizng JSON. If you are interested in learning more, consult the [MongoDB Documentation](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/) or [other resources](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/mongodb).

## Jupyterlab Notebook

A pretty straightforward, yet versatile application. Jupyterlab Notebook is a simpler more lightweight version of Jupyterlab. It offers a very simple interface using which users can open notebooks, terminals, and text files.

## NiFi

NiFi exists to automate the flow of data between systems. For example, if one system, computer, or source produces data, and another system consumes it, NiFi provides a means of automating the transfer of data between the two. For more information, refer to the [NiFi Documentation](https://nifi.apache.org/docs/nifi-docs/html/overview.html).


## Your task

Deploy these applications. The manifest files are provided, but some may require extra configuration on your part to work properly.
